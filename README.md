# Gmail UI

This is a simple electron applet to run Gmail as a desktop app.

## Why is this a thing?

I struggle with the amount of chrome tabs i open at work thus. This project so i can just Alt Tab to gmail instead of having to find the tab or open another one!

## How do i use it?

Simply download a pre packaged file from releases or compile the code your self using the `npm run build` command.

## Do you keep updating this project?

Not really. Whoever if any bugs arise please add an Issue and I will probably look to fix it.
